## 1. The model/view architecture

Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a design pattern originating from Smalltalk that is often used when building user interfaces. In [Design Patterns](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/guibooks.html#design-patterns), Gamma et al. write:

> MVC consists of **three** kinds of objects. The **Model** is the application object, the **View** is its screen presentation, and the **Controller** defines the way the user interface reacts to user input. Before MVC, user interface designs tended to lump these objects together. MVC decouples them to increase **flexibility** and **reuse**.

*If the view and the controller objects are combined, the result is the model/view architecture.* This still separates the way that data is stored from the way that it is presented to the user, but provides a **simpler framework** based on the same principles.

To allow flexible handling of user input, we introduce the concept of the **delegate.** The advantage of having a delegate in this framework is that it allows the way items of data are **rendered** and **edited** to be customized.

The model communicates with a source of data, providing an **interface** for the other components in the architecture. The nature of the communication depends on the type of data source, and the way the model is implemented.

The view obtains **model indexes** from the model; these are references to items of data. *By supplying model indexes to the model, the view can retrieve items of data from the data source*.

In standard views, a **delegate** renders the items of data. *When an item is edited, the delegate communicates with the model directly using model indexes*.

Each of these components is defined by **abstract** classes that provide common interfaces and, in some cases, default implementations of features.

Models, views, and delegates communicate with each other using **signals and slots**:

- Signals from the model inform the view about *changes to the data held by the data source*.
- Signals from the view provide information about *the user's interaction with the items being displayed*.
- Signals from the delegate are used during editing to *tell the model and view about the state of the editor*.

### 1.1 Models

All item models are based on the [QAbstractItemModel](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qabstractitemmodel.html) class. This class defines an interface that is used by views and delegates to access data. The data itself does not have to be stored in the model;

[QAbstractItemModel](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qabstractitemmodel.html) provides an interface to data that is flexible enough to handle views that represent data in the form of **tables**, **lists**, and **trees**. However, when implementing new models for list and table-like data structures, the [QAbstractListModel](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qabstractlistmodel.html) and [QAbstractTableModel](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qabstracttablemodel.html) classes are better starting points because they provide appropriate default implementations of common functions.

Qt provides some ready-made models that can be used to handle items of data:

- [QStringListModel](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qstringlistmodel.html) is used to store a simple list of [QString](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qstring.html) items.
- [QStandardItemModel](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qstandarditemmodel.html) manages more complex tree structures of items, each of which can contain arbitrary data.
- [QFileSystemModel](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qfilesystemmodel.html) provides information about files and directories in the local filing system.
- [QSqlQueryModel](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qsqlquerymodel.html), [QSqlTableModel](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qsqltablemodel.html), and [QSqlRelationalTableModel](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qsqlrelationaltablemodel.html) are used to access databases using model/view conventions.

If these standard models do not meet your requirements, you can subclass [QAbstractItemModel](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qabstractitemmodel.html), [QAbstractListModel](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qabstractlistmodel.html), or [QAbstractTableModel](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qabstracttablemodel.html) to create your own custom models.

### 1.2 Views

Complete implementations are provided for different kinds of views: [QListView](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qlistview.html) displays a list of items, [QTableView](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtableview.html) displays data from a model in a table, and [QTreeView](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtreeview.html) shows model items of data in a hierarchical list. Each of these classes is based on the [QAbstractItemView](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qabstractitemview.html) abstract base class. Although these classes are ready-to-use implementations, they can also be subclassed to provide customized views.

### 1.3 Delegates

[QAbstractItemDelegate](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qabstractitemdelegate.html) is the abstract base class for delegates in the model/view framework. The default delegate implementation is provided by [QStyledItemDelegate](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qstyleditemdelegate.html), and this is used as the default delegate by Qt's standard views. However, [QStyledItemDelegate](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qstyleditemdelegate.html)and [QItemDelegate](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qitemdelegate.html) are independent alternatives to painting and providing editors for items in views. The difference between them is that [QStyledItemDelegate](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qstyleditemdelegate.html) uses the current style to paint its items. We therefore recommend using [QStyledItemDelegate](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qstyleditemdelegate.html) as the base class when implementing custom delegates or when working with Qt style sheets.

## 2. Model Classes

### 2.1 Basic  concepts

In the model/view architecture, the model provides a standard interface that views and delegates use to access data. In Qt, the standard interface is defined by the [QAbstractItemModel](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qabstractitemmodel.html) class. No matter how the items of data are stored in any underlying data structure, all subclasses of [QAbstractItemModel](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qabstractitemmodel.html) represent the data as a hierarchical structure containing tables of items. Views use this *convention* to access items of data in the model, but they are not restricted in the way that they present this information to the user.

![img](assets/modelview-models.png)

#### 2.1.1  Model Indexes

To ensure that the representation of the data is kept separate from the way it is accessed, the concept of a **model index** is introduced. Each piece of information that can be obtained via a model is represented by a model index. Views and delegates use these indexes to request items of data to display.

As a result, only the model needs to know how to obtain data, and the type of data managed by the model can be defined fairly generally. *Model indexes contain a pointer to the model that created them*, and this prevents confusion when working with more than one model.

```c++
QAbstractItemModel *model = index.model();
```

Model indexes provide **temporary** references to pieces of information, and can be used to retrieve or modify data via the model. Since models may reorganize their internal structures from time to time, model indexes may become invalid, and *should not be stored*. If a long-term reference to a piece of information is required, a **persistent model index** must be created. This provides a reference to the information that the model keeps up-to-date. Temporary model indexes are provided by the [QModelIndex](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qmodelindex.html) class, and persistent model indexes are provided by the [QPersistentModelIndex](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qpersistentmodelindex.html) class.

To obtain a model index that corresponds to an item of data, three properties must be specified to the model: a **row number**, a **column number**, and the **model index of a parent item**. 

#### 2.1.2 Rows and columns

In its most basic form, a model can be accessed as a simple table in which items are located by their row and column numbers. *This does not mean that the underlying pieces of data are stored in an array structure*; the use of row and column numbers is only a convention to allow components to communicate with each other. 

```c++
QModelIndex index = model->index(row, column, ...);
```

![img](assets/modelview-tablemodel.png)

The diagram shows a representation of a basic table model in which each item is located by a pair of row and column numbers.

```c++
QModelIndex indexA = model->index(0, 0, QModelIndex());
QModelIndex indexB = model->index(1, 1, QModelIndex());
QModelIndex indexC = model->index(2, 1, QModelIndex());
```

Top level items in a model are always referenced by specifying `QModelIndex()` as their parent item. 

#### 2.1.3 Parents of items

The table-like interface to item data provided by models is ideal when using data in a table or list view; the row and column number system maps exactly to the way the views display items. However, structures such as tree views require the model to expose a more flexible interface to the items within. As a result, each item can also be the parent of another table of items, in much the same way that a top-level item in a tree view can contain another list of items.

When requesting an index for a model item, we must provide some information about the item's parent. Outside the model, the only way to refer to an item is through a model index, so a parent model index must also be given:

```c++
QModelIndex index = model->index(row, column, parent);
```

![img](assets/modelview-treemodel.png)

The diagram shows a representation of a tree model in which each item is referred to by a parent, a row number, and a column number.

```c++
QModelIndex indexA = model->index(0, 0, QModelIndex());
QModelIndex indexC = model->index(2, 1, QModelIndex());
QModelIndex indexB = model->index(1, 0, indexA);
```

##### 2.1.4 Item roles

Items in a model can perform various **roles** for other components, allowing different kinds of data to be supplied for different situations.

> For example, [Qt::DisplayRole](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qt.html#ItemDataRole-enum) is used to access a **string** that can be displayed as text in a view. Typically, items contain data for a number of different roles, and the standard roles are defined by [Qt::ItemDataRole](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qt.html#ItemDataRole-enum).

We can ask the model for the item's data by passing it the model index corresponding to the item, and by specifying a role to obtain the type of data we want:

```c++
QVariant value = model->data(index, role);
```

![img](assets/modelview-roles.png)

The role indicates to the model which type of data is being referred to. Views can display the roles in different ways, so it is important to supply appropriate information for each role.

## 3. View Classes

In the model/view architecture, the view obtains items of data from the model and presents them to the user. 

## 4. Delegate Classes

Unlike the Model-View-Controller pattern, the model/view design does not include a completely separate component for managing interaction with the user. Generally, the view is responsible for the presentation of model data to the user, and for processing user input. To allow some flexibility in the way this input is obtained, the interaction is performed by delegates. These components provide input capabilities and are also responsible for rendering individual items in some views. The standard interface for controlling delegates is defined in the [QAbstractItemDelegate](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qabstractitemdelegate.html) class.
